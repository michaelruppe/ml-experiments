  <h2>Doodle classifier</h2>
  <p>  Draw a simple <b>cat, house, fish, or guitar</b>!
    Then let the Doodle Classifer<button id="guess">guess</button>which one you've drawn.</p>
  Perhaps it guesses incorrectly,<button id="train">train</button>the neural network, and guess again (training takes a few seconds).
  <p></p>
  Feel free to<button id="erase">erase</button>and try drawing something else.
  <div id="result-holder">
       <!-- guess will display here -->
  </div>
  <div id="sketch-holder">
       <!-- sketch will go here! -->
  </div>
  <p><b>Note:</b> It's best if your drawing fills the box - try not to make it too small!
  Also, the neural network is about as accurate as it can be after only one round of training.</p>
  <button id="test">test</button>(This is for debugging, you'll need your console open)



  <h3>What's going on here?</h3>
    The Doodle Guesser starts out untrained - randomly guessing what you've drawn - pretty sucky.
    When you train the Doodle Guesser, a neural network is trained with a set of real, labelled doodles of cats, fish and houses and guitars - 800 of each
    The labels are used to make corrections to any incorrect guesses by tweaking the neurons within the network.
    The Doodle Guesser can still only <i>guess</i> at what you've drawn, there's no label. Hopefully after a round of training it's not too shabby.

  <h3>How did you make this?</h3>
  You can get the source code for this project from the <a href="https://github.com/michaelruppe/ml-experiments/tree/master/neural-networks-exercises/04-doodle-classifier">github repo</a>
  <p>This is my first stab at a neural network! It's garbage, but it's mine :)
  The network is a naieve approach for image classication - a fully connected 3 layer network (784 input pixels, 1 Hidden layer with 16 perceptrons, and a 4 outputs)</p>
  <p>It's coded with <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, a JavaScript library that allows for easily coding interactive, graphical scripts for the web.
  The Doodle Guesser is really an neural network programming example offered by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">The Coding Train</a>.
  If you want to build it yourself I'd recommend following along with:</p>
