# Neuro-evolution of an anti-aircraft gun

This implementation is largely incomplete. It counts as my first, unguided attempt at neuroevolution. Compared to the [flappy bird](/flappy-bird-neuroevolution) example, it's only feasable to test one member of a population here. So evolution does occur but I'm struggling with visualising only the best performer, and having that code fit neatly into the project. As it stands setting the slider far-left shows the best, and any other setting will evolve the population.
