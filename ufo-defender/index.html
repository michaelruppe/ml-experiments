    <p>This is my first completely unguided machine learning project - defending Earth with neuroevolution.</p>

    <p>Here, a neural network learns to solve a fire-control problem: How to hit a moving target with projectile motion.
    Like many beginner ML problems, of course this could be solved analytically. I think it makes for a neat project though.</p>

    <p>First, the game environment was created. This is:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>The physics that affect projectiles</li>
    <li>Building the gun and how it fires projectiles with a fixed speed at some angle.</li>
    <li>Logic to determine if a projectie hits a target.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Projectiles follow frictionless projectile motion:</p>

    <p><img src="projectile-motion-equations.gif" alt="Discrete-time equations for projectile motion" /></p>

    <p>Next, the neural network is given control of the gun, and fed information from the game enviroment.
    The neural network is dense (fully-connected) and has:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>4 Inputs: Target X-position, Target Y-Position, Target Speed, and a reload countdown.</li>
    <li>A single hidden layer with 8 neurons.</li>
    <li>2 Outputs: Gun-angle, and Fire.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A population of guns is trialled one-by-one. Each gun is controlled by a (randomly initialised) neural network.
    Performance is measured by how many UFOs are destroyed and how quickly. Near misses are also rewarded to encourage faster
    training during early generations.</p>

    <p>If a gun lets some UFOs through, itâ€™s killed-off and the next one takes its place. Once all the guns have been trialled,
    a new generation is created. Better-performing guns are more likely to pass their genetics (NN) on to the next generation.
    Small mutations may occur between generations.</p>

    <p>There are a few options for the user:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>train mode</strong>: perform neuro-evolution on the guns</li>
    <li><strong>best so far</strong>: display the best-performing gun that has been trained yet.</li>
    <li><strong>pretrained model</strong>: deploy a pretrained, well-performing neural network.</li>
    <li><strong>manual</strong>: take control of the gun yourself!</li>
    </ul>
