# Experiments in Machine Learning
I'm just mucking around here. Disregard whatever you see within this repo unless it's highlighted in this readme.
This documentation is more for my own notes.

### File structure
The following is the file tree that scripts will expect to be using. Raw data files that are easily reproduced/fetched are gitignored.
* ml-experiments [The Repository]
  * mnist
    * train-labels-idx3-ubyte
    * train-images-idx1-ubyte
    * t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte
    * t10k-images-idx3-ubyte

You can download the MNIST dataset [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
